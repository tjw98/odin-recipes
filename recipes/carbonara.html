    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g spaghetti</li>
        <li>100g pancetta (or bacon)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>50g Parmesan cheese (grated)</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. 
            Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions 
            until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, 
            then drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancetta: While the pasta is cooking, heat a large pan 
            over medium heat. Add the pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, 
            about 4-5 minutes. Remove the pancetta and set it aside, 
            leaving the fat in the pan.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce: In a bowl, whisk the eggs and grated Parmesan 
            cheese together until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine everything: In the same pan with the pancetta fat, add the 
            minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant. 
            Then, add the drained spaghetti to the pan and toss to coat. 
            Remove the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the egg and cheese 
            mixture. Toss the pasta rapidly 
            to prevent the eggs from scrambling.</li>
        <li>Adjust the sauce: If the pasta looks too dry, add a bit of the 
            reserved pasta water to make it creamy. Stir in the cooked pancetta, 
            and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve: Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and extra 
            Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
