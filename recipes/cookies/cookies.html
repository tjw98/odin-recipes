    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A beloved baked treat with a chewy or crispy texture, made from butter, 
        sugar, flour, and studded with sweet chocolate chips. 
        Perfect for dessert or snacking.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (226g) unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) brown sugar (packed)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups (280g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 cups (340g) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking 
            sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
        <li>Mix wet ingredients: In a large bowl, cream together the softened 
            butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs 
            one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking 
            soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry mixture into the wet mixture 
            and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add chocolate chips: Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are 
            evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Shape the cookies: Drop spoonfuls of dough (about a tablespoon each) 
            onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies: Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges are 
            golden brown but the centers are still soft. Remove from the oven 
            and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes 
            before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: Enjoy the cookies warm or store them in an airtight 
            container for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
